# DeepOilFlow

This project designs an AI deep learning system to predict future oil production rates for petroleum wells using historical production data. 

The implementation includes advanced features such as:
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Learning rate scheduling
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis
- And much more!

The SHAP analysis presents us with interpretable insights into which production parameters influence future oil rates. 

This transparency is crucial for geologists to validate the model's predictions relative to domain knowledge.
